Javascript Calculator

The first version of this script was very simple and added up two numbers a user typed in. 
After wanting to further practice my Javascript and CSS knowledge the App was redone with traditional calculator button inputs and all the logic of a standard calculator.

Future versions:
  At some point I would like to further expand the calculator to make it a scientific calculator.


Installation
  You can add the script and styles to your sites STATIC folder then either add add a new html page or insert the example html page into an existing one.
